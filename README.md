My first approach of php and JS at 42

## camagru @ 42

Just install it on a web server, and run /config.php

Features: 
- Auto database configuration from browser(only works once,
if you made a mistake you may have to change infos in the configuration file)
- Drag & Drop stickers directky on your picture
- Content is fetched dynamically
- As subject require it, all collages are made serverside
- Code isn't clean at all as it was my first xp (yeah, this might not be the appopriate section for this,
but let's say it is a feature)
- Infinite picture wall (auto loading upcoming content when you're nearly at the end of the page)
- I tried to make it fancy and reduced as much as possible, with a really simple UX and light UI.






post-scriptum : I can assure you that I now code cleaner and better :D
